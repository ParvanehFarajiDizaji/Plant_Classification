# Section 2: "CNN - Advanced Image Classification"

- *Task:*
    - Building on the first section, you will now use a CNN to tackle the same image classification task, but with a more complex and larger dataset Plant Disease Recognition  Classification. You should design a CNN architecture that improves upon the performance of the MLP.

- *Objectives:*
    - Resize all images to a uniform size 128 * 128
    - Normalize pixel values to be in the range [0, 1]
    - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test) and report accuracy and loss value on each one.
    - Implement a CNN architecture, utilizing concepts such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dropout. (atleast two model for comparision)
    - Train the model on the training dataset and evaluate its performance on the test set.
    - Plot the training and validation accuracy/loss curves to analyze model performance over epochs.

- *Deliverables:*

    - A detailed report on the CNN architecture, including layer-by-layer explanations, choice of activation functions, and regularization techniques.
    - Performance comparison between the MLP and CNN models.
    - A reflection on the importance of feature extraction in CNNs versus MLPs.
